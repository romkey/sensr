# Sensr Base Board 0.1

## Errata

- built in LED did not operate correctly
- board used IO35, IO36 and IO37 which are needed for PSRAM
- PSRAM doesn't work beause of pin conflict
- 
- JLCPCB apparently [cannot correctly assemble MEMS microphones](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/1jy9k0o/warning_jlcpcb_cannot_reliably_handle_mems/) so the integrated I2S microphone does not work correctly
